Oh no! Last night a UFO kidnapped ShakeyBanks! 

I created this project in the span of 24 hours to test my ability to produce quality work under a strict deadline, and I must say that though at the time I felt stressed to finished, I am really pleased with how this animation turned out. Every detail is as I imagined it to be. Here's hoping you enjoy it too! Clicking the photo will take you to the finished product on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/wNwOEFcaNSY)
